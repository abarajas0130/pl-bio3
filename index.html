		<li><p>I am a senior attending Eastern Washington University</p></li>
		<li><p>Over the years I have always had that keen eye in art. I grew up doing photography, from new born portraits to high fashion photography. I&#39;ve always leaned towards the high fashion photography side just because it&#39;s a lot more artistic. That being said, art is a big part of me and looking forward to learn other artistic skills from typography to sketching and from website development to sculpturing. I want to perfect the skills I&#39;ve developed and learn new ones. </p></li>

		<section class="grid_6 omega">
		<li><p>I ultimately want to focus on branding businesses. I want to be able to find solutions for entrepreneurs that are struggling in marketing themselves. The colors, design and typography has to be perfectly designed and chosen just because there is a lot psychology involved. </p></li>

		<li><p>A lot of people ask me, &quot;What are you majoring in?&quot; and I tell them, &quot;I&#39;m majoring in Visual Communications Design.&quot; They are like, &quot;ohhhh, that&#39;s a really cool major.&quot; In reality they have no idea what this major is. This major is very broad according to a lot of that are out there. In my own experience throughout the program I have experienced many different classes and they are completely different. I feel like this major prepares individuals to be able to do any job in a marketing or advertising company.</p></li>
